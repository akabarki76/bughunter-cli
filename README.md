##  Key Features

###  AI-Powered Intelligence
- **Conversational Interface**: `bughunter vibe "Find XSS vulnerabilities in auth module"`
- **Autocorrection**: AI-generated patches for identified vulnerabilities
- **Contextual Analysis**: LLM-powered vulnerability interpretation

###  Comprehensive Scanning Suite
```bash
# Code scanning (Semgrep-powered)
bughunter scan code ./src --autocorrect

# Dependency analysis (OSV-scanner)
bughunter scan dependencies ./requirements.txt

# Infrastructure recon
bughunter scan subdomains example.com
bughunter scan ports 192.168.1.1
```

###  GitHub Integration
```bash
# Initialize GitHub integration
bughunter github init

# Manage security findings as issues
bughunter github create-issue "SQLi vulnerability detected"
```

### ️ Extensible Architecture
- Language-agnostic scanning
- Plugin system for new scanners
- Future-proof AI integration points

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- [Gemini API Key](https://aistudio.google.com/)
- [GitHub PAT](https://github.com/settings/tokens)

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/akabarki76/bughunter-cli.git
cd bughunter-cli
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Install security scanners
brew install nmap cppcheck    # macOS
sudo apt-get install nmap cppcheck  # Debian/Ubuntu
```

### Configuration
```bash
# Set Gemini API key
echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env

# Configure GitHub integration
bughunter github init
```

##  Usage Examples

### Basic Scanning
```bash
# Scan Python project with autocorrection
bughunter scan code ./project --autocorrect

# Find vulnerable dependencies
bughunter scan dependencies ./project
```

### Natural Language Interface
```bash
bughunter vibe "Audit authController.js for injection flaws"
bughunter vibe "Explain CVE-2023-12345 in simple terms"
bughunter vibe "Generate patch for the SQLi in userService.py"
```

### Advanced Workflows
```bash
# Full security audit pipeline
bughunter vibe "Scan entire project, fix critical issues, and create GitHub tickets"

# CI/CD integration (example)
- name: Security Audit
  run: |
    bughunter scan code ./src
    bughunter scan dependencies
```

##  VibeOps Philosophy

bughunter-cli embodies our core engineering principles:
1. **AI-First Automation** - Machines handle routine tasks, humans solve hard problems
2. **Conversational DevEx** - Natural language as primary interface
3. **Continuous Evolution** - Always integrating cutting-edge AI research
4. **Inclusive Security** - Democratizing security expertise

## ️ Roadmap
